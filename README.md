# Fork of Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity, for supporting VisionOS via PolySpatial

I don't recommend using this repo any more. I would advice using Fully immersive mode with pass-through, available from VisionOS2. That way, shaders don't need other be rebuilt. 

WIP and some more info can be found on [this branch](https://github.com/jelmer3000/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity-PolySpatial/tree/wip-polyspatial-visionOS-support)
